ColorXing
=========

ColorXing is intended to be a game of territory.
It aims to abstract the details of how influnce is spread into simple to understand colors.

Currently it is just a framework upon which the game will be built.

next:
+ grids can hold items, squares behave/drawn differently depending on the items held
+ players can be held in grids
+ players move around grids with arrow keys, current/visited nodes behave differently

done:
+ average color algorithm
+ color reacting grid (looks like a lava lamp)
